What is list ?
=> a built in datatype that store set fo values.
It can store elements of different types(integer,float ,string,etc.)

marks=["karan",85,"Delhi"]
print(marks[0])=>karan

what is the difference btw the list and string ?
string are immutable means that they are inchangeable like we can only access it values but cannot change them 
list are mutable means that they are changeable they are accessible and as well as changeable 
this is main diff btw the list and string.........
what is tuple ?
=>tuple is a inbuilt data type of python used to store value but it is 
ordered unchangeable and duplicate values are allowed in it....
it is made using ()<-------bracket 
what is slicing in tuple ?
=>similar to string slicing
list_name[starting_idx:ending_idx] #ending idx is not included

marks=[87,64,33,95,76]

marks[1:4] is [64,33,95]

note:- we can do the slicing in the negative index manner also 
There are so many inbuilt function of list...
list.append(4)
list.sort()
list.sort(reverse=True)
list.reverse()
list.insert(idx,el)
